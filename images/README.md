Images folder

Place your site images here so paths are relative and will work when hosted.

Suggested files:
- family-hero.jpg  (1920px wide max, ~250–350 KB) — used in the hero section

Tips:
- Use JPG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency, or WebP for best size.
- Keep filenames kebab-case and short.
- After copying files here, update index.html src attributes to use `images/<filename>`.
